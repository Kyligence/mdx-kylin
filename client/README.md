## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start` or `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

**Debug in IDE:** If you're using Visual Studio Code, you can install the extension [Debugger for Chrome](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msjsdiag.debugger-for-chrome) to debug the code in IDE.
You should run `yarn start` at first. And then, click `Debug and Run` tab in IDE, choose **Debug app code**, and click the start debug.

Enjoy it!

### `yarn test` or `npm run test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

**Debug in IDE:** If you're using Visual Studio Code, you can click `Debug and Run` tab in IDE, choose **Debug test code**, and click the start debug.

**Run in CI:** If you run the test with PR check, you should run `CI=true yarn test` or `CI=true npm run test`.

**Get Test Coverage:** If you would like to get the coverage report, you should run `CI=true yarn test -- --coverage` or `CI=true npm run test -- --coverage`.

Enjoy it!

### `yarn build` or `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
